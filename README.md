# E-SAGE: Explainability-based Defense Against Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks
An official implementation of "E-SAGE: Explainability-based Defense Against Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks"[[paper]]()

Our method is implemented based on the [[UGBA]](https://github.com/ventr1c/UGBA) framework. To reproduce our work, you also need to install Pytorch from [[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to get the  explainability component.
You can also install only relevant packages, which will not conflict with existing environments.
